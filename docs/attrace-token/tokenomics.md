While Attrace is on its mission to unlock the value of "word-of-mouth" marketing in web3, $ATTR token and the community are the centerpieces essential in providing the protocol's security, trust  and the sustainable growth. Attrace tokenomics revolves around the three key aspects where $ATTR will play a crucial role: Oracle Staking, Referral Farming and Governance

## Oracle Staking 

The most important role of $ATTR is to provide sufficient security and trust in the network of Oracles via staking. Through the rewarding and slashing mechanism, staking enforces Oracles to detect and capture the “added value” via “world or mouth” marketing in a truthful manner. Staking can be done in one of the two ways:


### Staking by operating an Oracle

Those who stake a required amount of $ATTR tokens will be able to run their Oracle and be rewarded for their service of providing security and trust in the Network (the exact amount is yet to be determined and announced). A required stake to run an Oracle can also be achieved via delegated staking of other token holders. Since operating Oracles incurs costs, Oracle operators will be able charge a fee to those delegating the stake to offset for their own operating costs. Oracle operators can decide how much commission to charge on the staking rewards earned on the delegated stake (i.e. 10% commission of staking rewards).

### Delegating stake to an Oracle

Those who do not have a sufficient amount of $ATTR staked or do not want to operate an Oracle will be able to delegate stake to a running Oracle. By delegating stake you are still earning rewards which will be deducted for the commission rate charged by the Oracle operator. Commission rate is visible to everyone even before delegating the stake and is not a subject of a change for the existing delegated stake. 

## Staking Rewards

As a reward for the  service of providing security and trust in the network, the stakers receive the budgeted staking rewards in addition to the part of the protocol fees coming from the referral farms: 

- The staking budget in $ATTR has been set at 10% of the total tokens supply of $ATTR tokens (100M $ATTR), which will be distributed over the period of 30 months (starting with January 2022). Additionally, rewards as part of the Protocol Fee will be distributed to the stakers. 
- Part of the rewards coming from Protocol Fees (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee), would be collected from Referral Farm Rewards (i.e. $ETH or other crypto chosen as reward token by the those who creates a referral farm)

Eventually, it is expected that the network will be sustainable on the basis of protocol fees. The following is the anticipated staking rewards schedule:

- Rewards during Pre-staking period (started at the end of December 2021): Staking rewards in $ATTR (10M $ATTR) 
- Rewards during Staking period (anticipated in the first 2 years): Staking rewards in $ATTR (exact amount TBA) + 3% fee from Referral Fams (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee)
- Rewards during Staking period (after 2 years): 3% fee from Referral Farms (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee)

## Earning Rewards 

Staking rewards from the staking budget and part of the protocol fees, are distributed to operating Oracles in proportion to their amount of stake. That means that Oracles earn rewards based on their share of the total amount of tokens staked. 

oracle daily rewards = (oracle stake / total stake) x daily staking rewards

Before the rewards are distributed to the Oracles, the amount of tokens earned via delegated stake is distributed to stake delegators (deducted for the commission set by the Oracle operator). 

## Example

An Oracle A has 10m $ATTR staked with 3m $ATTR of delegated stake. There is a total of 100m $ATTR staking within the network of Oracles which means that Oracle A is entitled to 10% of the daily staking rewards (3% of delegated stake). Oracle operator charges 10% commission on the rewards earned by the delegated stake. 

Part of the protocol fees collected that day which is dedicated to staking is 10 $ETH and the staking budget in $ATTR daily rewards amounts to 100,000 $ATTR. The rewards are distributed to all stakers based on their share in the total amount of stake. 

**Oracle daily gross rewards**

```
= (10% x 10 ETH) + (10% x 100,000 ATTR)
= 1 ETH + 10,000 ATTR
```

**Delegator’s rewards**

```
= (90% x (3% x 10 ETH)) + (90% x (3% x 100,000 ATTR)) 
= 0.27 ETH + 2,700 ATTR
```

**Oracle daily net rewards** 

```
= (Oracle daily gross rewards) - (Delegator’s rewards) 
= 0.73 ETH + 7,300 ATTR
