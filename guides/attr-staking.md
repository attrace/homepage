The most important role of $ATTR is to provide sufficient security and trust in the network of Oracles via staking. As a token holder, you are able to stake your $ATTR before the Oracle network becomes public (currently in the preliminary staking stage). The aim of the preliminary staking is to collect a sufficient amount of staked $ATTR before activating the Oracle Network. [Learn more about Oracles](/about/oracles).

You can deposit your $ATTR tokens into the pre-staking contract on Ethereum via https://attrace.com/staking. There is no minimum amount of tokens required to stake. Those who stake within the pre-staking period will become eligible to operate Oracle when the network becomes public (see [roadmap](/about/roadmap)).
