#### _Total Farm Rewards_

#### _Estimated APR_ 
Estimated Annual Percentage Rate is the current rate of return that those who join the farm can expect to earn on an annual basis for the amount of the tokens purchased via referral link 

#### _Farm position_ 
Position is created for those who join the farm based on the value of tokens purchased via referral link.
