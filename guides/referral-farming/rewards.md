Referral farming rewards are distributed to those who successfully recommend/promote a token (Refer to Farm) and those who buy the token via the referral link (Buy to Farm). The rewards are paid out daily to all the users who join the farm via daily farming rewards based on their share in the total farm “position” for that day. 

A “position” in the referral farm is created for an individual who recommended/promoted a token and the one who bought the token via the referral link (position = amount of tokens purchased). Both parties receive the same “position” in the farm, in the amount of the tokens bought, to equally account for their “added value” to the token community (effectively double “position” is created).   

- **referer position** = amount of tokens purchased via referer's referral link
- **buyer position** = amount of tokens purchased via referral link
- **total position** = all referer positions + all buyers positions

The higher one’s share of the total position is, the bigger portion of the daily rewards they earn.   
Individual’s “position” can increase when one buys more tokens, or decrease when one sells their tokens (buy and hold mechanism).   One will keep on earning daily rewards as long as there is a positive “position” (i.e. position > 0), or until the referral farm runs out of rewards (i.e. total referral rewards = 0). 

**My daily rewards:**

`(my position / total position) x daily rewards`

Estimated **APR** (Annual Percentage Rate) is an indicator of current rewards one can earn for the value of tokens purchased. Keep in mind that this is an estimated rate which can increase or decrease depending on the total amount of tokens purchased and held via referrals (total farm “position”).

**Estimated APR**

`(daily rewards / total farm “position”) x 365 x 100`

### Example

- Referral farm with $ABC referred token rewards 100 $ABC daily for successful referrals (total rewards deposited = 5.000 $ABC)
- Alice believes in $ABC, decides to Refer to Farm and creates her referral link and shares with her community
- A few members of her community buy 10K $ABC in total  
- Alice and her community join the referral farm with position of 10K $ABC (10k $ABC Alice + 10k $ABC her community => total position in the farm = 20K $ABC)
- Alice owns ½ of the total farm “position” and receives 50 $ABC each day, while 50 $ABC is distributed among Alice’s community which bought $ABC via her referral link (each community member earns per their own “position’)
- Alice and her community stop earning rewards when their position is sold or when the total rewards budget becomes empty (would empty in 50 days since the total rewards deposited were 5.000 $ABC)

#### APR calculation 

Applying the daily rewards formula as explained above:

**APR** 
```
= 100 $ABC daily rewards / (5.000 $ABC Alice + 5.000 $ATTR Alice community) x 365 x 100
= 100 $ABC / 10.000 $ABC x 365 x 100
= 365%
