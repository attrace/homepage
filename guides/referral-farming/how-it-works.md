Referral farming is where a project incentivises purchase of its tokens via referrals, by rewarding both referrers and buyers. 
This is how it works: 

- As a referrer, you can explore the referral farms of different tokens in the app and create your unique referral link for any token you would like to recommend or promote  
- Grab the link and share it with your communities, friends or family 
- You and the buyers you refer will join the referral farm and start earning farming rewards when buyers purchase a token via your referral link
- You and the referred buyers earn a share of the daily farm rewards based on the value purchased via your referral link
- The rewards are distributed daily and available for claiming 

:::tip
- The earlier you refer buyers the higher the chance to earn a bigger share of the daily rewards
- The more tokens people buy via you referral link the bigger the share of your daily rewards
- The longer the buyers hold the tokens (Buy and Hold) the longer both you and the buyers will receive the rewards
:::

## Key Terms

Before you start, there are few key terms you should get to know: 

#### _Daily Farm Rewards_
Rewards distributed daily to the addresses of those who join the referral farms. Rewards are distributed to addresses based on the share of the total “farm position” 

#### _Total Farm Rewards_
Total amount of reward tokens deposited in the referral farm that will be distributed to those who join the farm

#### _Estimated APR_ 
Estimated Annual Percentage Rate is the current rate of return that those who join the farm can expect to earn on an annual basis for the amount of the tokens purchased via referral link 

#### _Farm position_ 
Position is created for those who join the farm based on the value of tokens purchased via referral link, your farm position is equal to 1) the amount of tokens someone purchased via your referral link or 2) the amount of tokens you purchased via someone else’s referral link
