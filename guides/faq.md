### How to choose which token to recommend or promote? 
We strongly recommend that you share the token you value and believe in. The rewards are paid out daily by incentivising the holding of the tokens, therefore, it is advisable that you recommend those tokens that you believe will also retain value and potential over time. Another way to assess which token you would like to recommend or promote is by looking at the Daily Farm Rewards and Estimated APR. 

### How do I earn rewards? 
There are two ways to earn farming rewards: 1) when someone buys the recommended token via your ref link 2) when you buy the recommended token via someone’s ref link

### How are my rewards calculated? 
You earn daily rewards based on the amount of tokens purchased via the referral link (either link you shared with others or link shared with you). This amount represents your “position” in the referral farm. You earn a portion of the daily rewards based on your share in the total “farm position”. The higher your share of the total position is, the bigger portion of the daily rewards you earn. Your own “position” can increase if you buy more tokens, or decrease if you sell your tokens (buy and hold mechanism).

### What if I buy a token via CEX? 
At the moment only purchases of tokens via DEXs are supported and considered for successful referrals.  

### What DEXs are supported?
At the moment only purchases of tokens via Uniswap and Sushiswap are supported. How about DEX aggregators (e.g. 1inch)? 

### What is a target redirect link?
That is a link to a DEX or Marketplace where the potential buyers would be redirected after completing the required steps within Attrace App

### What is the protocol fee?
The protocol fee of 5% is a service fee paid by those who create a referral farm. It is automatically deducted from referral farming rewards. The protocol fee is distributed to Oracles and users of Attrace Referral Farm (60% allocated to Oracles; 40% allocated to Attrace Referral Farm). 

### What is the difference between a referred token and reward token?   
Referred token is the token which is being promoted or recommended. People are incentivised to “spread the word” about that token with the rewards deposited in the referral farm. The deposited token for rewards is what we call the reward token. While the reward token can be the same as the referred token (especially in the case of fungible tokens - e.g. erc20), it can also be different (decision of those who create referral farm)
