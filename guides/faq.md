### How to choose which token to recommend or promote? 
We strongly recommend that you share the token you value and believe in – it is a personal decision. The rewards are paid out daily by incentivising the holding of the tokens. Therefore, it is advisable that you recommend those tokens that you believe will also retain value and potential over time. Another way to assess which token you would like to recommend or promote is by looking at the Daily Farm Rewards and Estimated APR. 

### How are my rewards calculated (how much can I earn)? 
You earn a share of total daily rewards based on the amount of tokens purchased via the referral link (either the link you shared with others, or the link shared with you). This amount represents your “position” in the referral farm. You earn a portion of the daily rewards based on your share in the total “farm position”. The higher your share of the total position, the bigger portion of the daily rewards you earn. Your own “position” can increase if you buy more tokens (or someone buys via our referral link), or decrease if you sell your tokens (buy and hold mechanism). For more details check [the rewards distribution and example](/guides/referral-farming/rewards).

### How do I join a referral farm and start earning rewards? 
There are two ways to earn farming rewards: 1) When someone buys the recommended token via your referral link; 2) when you buy the recommended token via someone else’s referral link.

### What is the Referral Rate (estimate) and how do I use it? 

This is the current annualised rate that as a **referrer** you earn for the amount of tokens purchased via your referral link. It is an estimated rate which changes daily depending on the total amount of tokens purchased via all referral links (total farm position). For example, the higher the total amount purchased (higher total farm position), the lower the referral rate you would earn and vice versa. Therefore, you may use this rate only as an estimate of your future earnings.

### What is the Estimated APR and how do I use it? 

This is the current annualised rate that as a **buyer** you earn for the amount of tokens purchased via someone's referral link. It is an estimated rate which changes daily depending on the total amount of tokens purchased via all referral links (total farm position). For example, the higher the total amount purchased (higher total farm position), the lower the APR you would earn and vice versa. Therefore, you may use this rate only as an estimate of your future earnings.

### On which DEXs and blockchains can the tokens be bought via the referral link?
At the moment, only purchases of tokens via **Uniswap** and **Sushiswap** on **Ethereum** are supported and considered as sucessful referrals. Purchase of tokens on another DEX will not entitle you for rewards.  

### What if I buy a token via CEX? 
At the moment only purchases of tokens via DEXs are supported and considered for successful referrals.  

### What is "ATTR (12m vest)" token?

This token is used to reward users who join referral farms sponsored by Attrace protocol. This token has 12 months vesting rules and upon vesting can be redemed/swapped for the actual ATTR token. The vesting period starts from the moment that one claims the rewards in this token. Each month 1/12 of the claimed amount becomes vested and it can be swapped for ATTR token. 

### What is the protocol fee?
The protocol fee of 5% is a service fee paid by those who create a referral farm. It is automatically deducted from referral farming rewards. The protocol fee is distributed to Oracles and users of Attrace Referral Farm (60% allocated to Oracles; 40% allocated to Attrace Referral Farm). 

### What is the difference between a referred token and reward token?   
A Referred token is the token which is being promoted or recommended. People are incentivised to “spread the word” about that token with the rewards deposited in the referral farm. A Reward token is the token deposited for rewards. While the reward token can be the same as the referred token (especially in the case of fungible tokens - e.g., erc20), it can also be different (decision of those who create referral farm)
