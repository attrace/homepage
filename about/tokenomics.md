_Tokenomics and $ATTR deep dive: WOM Oracles, Referral Farms and Governance_

This article is intended to share the vision about tokenomics, the role of $ATTR in the Attrace Protocol and its future plans. Attrace is on its mission to unlock the value of "Word-Of-Mouth" marketing in web3, and $ATTR token and the community will be playing a key role in accomplishing this goal by providing services which are essential for its growth and success. Following this goal, the team has progressively evolved the protocol with the strategy which ensures the relevant incentives for the protocol stakeholders, users and supporters.

While the protocol will keep evolving based on the feedback from the community, partners and users, we are confident that the following updates will provide strong incentives to join Attrace and will set a stage for growth that will benefit all $ATTR token holders, as well as Attrace partners and users. 

This article will cover the tokenomics update in regards to the three key aspects where $ATTR  will play a crucial role: Attrace Oracles, Referral Farms and Governance token. 

## Oracles

As previously announced, the Attrace community will be able to run an Oracle and be rewarded for their service of providing security and trust in the Network. The staking budget has been set at 10% of the total tokens supply of $ATTR tokens (100M $ATTR) which will be distributed over the period of 30 months (starting with January 2022). Additionally, rewards as part of the Protocol Fee will be distributed to the stakers. Eventually, it is expected that the network will be sustainable on the basis of protocol fees:

* Rewards during Pre-staking period: Staking rewards in $ATTR (10M $ATTR)
* Rewards during Staking period (anticipated in the first 2 years): Staking rewards in $ATTR (exact amount TBA) + 3% fee from Referral Fams (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee)
* Rewards during Staking period (after 2 years): 3% fee from Referral Farms (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee)

The major update is that part of the rewards coming from Protocol Fees (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee), would be collected from Referral Farm Rewards (i.e. $ETH or other crypto chosen as reward token by the those who creates a referral farm)

## Referral Farming

Inspired by the DeFi core concept of yield farming, the Attrace team is developing Referral Farms which by design provide a strong incentive to join the protocol. While Referral Farms will be the engine of sustainable protocol growth, it is important to note that $ATTR tokenomics will not follow an inflationary scheme similar to AMMs. As previously mentioned, there will be two types of farms and the following is an update to the Attrace tokenomics related to Referral Farms. This approach will allow anyone to start recommending or promoting crypto or NFT projects they believe in.  


### Single Token Farms

Those who join Referral Farms will earn rewards in the crypto deposited by those who create a farm to incentivise the referrals of a crypto token or NFT collection (i.e. $ETH or other crypto chosen as reward token by the sponsor). It should be noted that there will be a 5% Protocol Fee which will be taken as part of the deposit. 

* ⅗ of the Protocol Fee or 3% of Referral Farm Rewards will go to stakers who run WOM Oracles   

* ⅖ of theProtocol Fees or 2% of Referral Farm Rewards will be distributed as a reward for those who join Attrace Referral Farm
 

### Multi Token Farms

The intention of Multi Token Farm is to incentivise and reward early adoption and usage of the protocol and also grow the Attrace community. Furthermore, the aim is to also provide a sustainable long term incentive for the future protocol usage. 

At the beginning, those who join Attrace Referral Farm will earn Rewards in $ATTR and 2% Protocol Fees collected from the Sponsored Referral Farms. The intention of rewards in $ATTR is to kickstart the protocol usage, with the expectation that Protocol Fees will provide a sufficient incentive for the future usage.  

```Attrace Referral Farm Rewards = $ATTR Referral Farm Rewards + 2% Protocol Fee```

Rewards in $ATTR will account for 10M $ATTR (10% of the total token supply) which will be distributed to the users over the period of 30 months (the exact release schedule to be announced)

2% Protocol Fees collected from the sponsored referral farms in different crypto will be rewarded to those who join Attrace Referral Farm.
