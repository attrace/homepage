While Attrace is on its mission to unlock the value of "word-of-mouth" in web3, $ATTR token and the community are the centerpieces essential in providing the protocol's security, trust  and the sustainable growth. Attrace tokenomics revolves around the three key aspects where $ATTR will play a crucial role: Oracle Staking, Referral Farming and Governance

## Oracle Staking 

The most important role of $ATTR is to provide sufficient security and trust in the network of Oracles via staking. Through the rewarding and slashing mechanism, staking enforces Oracles to detect and capture the “added value” via “world of mouth” marketing in a truthful manner. Staking with Oracles will become possible only once the Oracle network becomes public (see [roadmap](/about/roadmap)).

Oracles will be possible in one of the two ways:

### Staking by operating an Oracle

Those who stake a required amount of $ATTR tokens will be able to run their Oracle and be rewarded for their service of providing security and trust in the Network (the exact amount is yet to be determined and announced). A required stake to run an Oracle can also be achieved via delegated staking of other token holders. Since operating Oracles incurs costs, Oracle operators will be able charge a fee to those delegating the stake to offset for their own operating costs. Oracle operators can decide how much commission to charge on the staking rewards earned on the delegated stake (i.e. 10% commission of staking rewards).

### Delegating stake to an Oracle

Those who do not have a sufficient amount of $ATTR staked or do not want to operate an Oracle will be able to delegate stake to a running Oracle. By delegating stake you are still earning rewards which will be deducted for the commission rate charged by the Oracle operator. Commission rate is visible to everyone even before delegating the stake and is not a subject of a change for the existing delegated stake.

### Staking Rewards

As a reward for the  service of providing security and trust in the network, the stakers receive the budgeted staking rewards in addition to the part of the protocol fees coming from the referral farms: 

- The staking budget in $ATTR has been set at 10% of the total tokens supply of $ATTR tokens (100M $ATTR), which will be distributed over the period of 30 months (starting with January 2022). Additionally, rewards as part of the Protocol Fee will be distributed to the stakers. 
- Part of the rewards coming from Protocol Fees (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee), would be collected from Referral Farm Rewards (i.e. $ETH or other crypto chosen as reward token by the those who creates a referral farm)

Eventually, it is expected that the network will be sustainable on the basis of protocol fees. The following is the anticipated staking rewards schedule:

- Rewards during Pre-staking period (started at the end of December 2021): Staking rewards in $ATTR (10M $ATTR) 
- Rewards during Staking period (anticipated in the first 2 years): Staking rewards in $ATTR (exact amount TBA) + 3% fee from Referral Fams (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee)
- Rewards during Staking period (after 2 years): 3% fee from Referral Farms (⅗ from 5% Protocol Fee)

:::note
Oracle Staking will happen once the Oracle Network becomes public. Until that point the distribution of rewards as described in the pre-staking period will be applicable.

### Earning Rewards 

Staking rewards from the staking budget and part of the protocol fees, are distributed to operating Oracles in proportion to their amount of stake. That means that Oracles earn rewards based on their share of the total amount of tokens staked. 

`oracle daily rewards = (oracle stake / total stake) x daily staking rewards`

Before the rewards are distributed to the Oracles, the amount of tokens earned via delegated stake is distributed to stake delegators (deducted for the commission set by the Oracle operator). 

### Example

An Oracle A has 10m $ATTR staked with 3m $ATTR of delegated stake. There is a total of 100m $ATTR staking within the network of Oracles which means that Oracle A is entitled to 10% of the daily staking rewards (3% of delegated stake). Oracle operator charges 10% commission on the rewards earned by the delegated stake. 

Part of the protocol fees collected that day which is dedicated to staking is 10 $ETH and the staking budget in $ATTR daily rewards amounts to 100,000 $ATTR. The rewards are distributed to all stakers based on their share in the total amount of stake. 

**Oracle daily gross rewards**

```
= (10% x 10 ETH) + (10% x 100,000 ATTR)
= 1 ETH + 10,000 ATTR
```

**Delegator’s rewards**

```
= (90% x (3% x 10 ETH)) + (90% x (3% x 100,000 ATTR)) 
= 0.27 ETH + 2,700 ATTR
```

**Oracle daily net rewards** 

```
= (Oracle daily gross rewards) - (Delegator’s rewards) 
= 0.73 ETH + 7,300 ATTR

## Referral Farming

Referral farming is designed to provide strong incentive for successful referrals of web3 tokens across ecosystems, while at the same time generating value to Attrace protocol and its community. 

As the general rewards mechanism is explained in the referral farming, this section focuses on the role of ATTR tokenomics in the referral farming. There are a two major aspects where ATTR plays a role:


### Protocol Fees

Envisioned as the engine of sustainable protocol growth, referral farms will drive value to Attrace community through protocol fees collected from sponsored referral farms. The protocol fee is currently set to 5% and will be a subject of the future governance decision. That means that 5% of the protocol referral farming rewards (protocol TVL) will be distributed to stakers and Attrace users. 

While the referral farming rewards can be in various tokens (i.e. erc2), the tokens collected via protocol fees will be exchanged to ATTR before being distributed to the staker and users. The protocol fees are distributed per following breakdown:

- ⅗ of the Protocol Fee or 3% of Referral Farm Rewards will go to stakers who run Attrace Oracles   
- ⅖ of the Protocol Fees or 2% of Referral Farm Rewards will be distributed as a reward for those who join Attrace Referral Farm

### Attrace Referral Farm 
(protocol native referral farm)

The intention of Attrace Referral Farm is to incentivise and reward early adoption and usage of the protocol and also grow the Attrace community. Furthermore, the aim is to also provide a sustainable long term incentive for the future protocol usage. 

At the beginning, those who join Attrace Referral Farm will earn Rewards as part of the ATTR token distribution as well as ⅖ of the Protocol Fees collected from the Sponsored Referral Farms. The intention of rewards in $ATTR is to kickstart the protocol usage, with the expectation that Protocol Fees will provide a sufficient incentive for the future usage.  

=> Attrace Referral Farm Rewards = $ATTR Referral Farm Rewards + ⅖ Protocol Fee (2% of referral farm rewards)

- Rewards in $ATTR will account for 10M $ATTR (10% of the total token supply) which will be distributed to the users over the period of 30 months (the exact release schedule to be announced)
- ⅖ of Protocol Fees collected from the sponsored referral farms in various tokens will be converted to $ATTR and transferred to the reward pool 


## Governance
Governance is envisioned as an integral part of the protocol which will ultimately lead to DAO in future (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). The road to DAO will not be built immediately,  as it also requires decentralization and a public network of oracles to be in place. The governance will be rolled out incrementally and will be announced in future. 

Envisioned some of community roles in the future DAO:

- Community as Attrace Referral Farm treasury custodian
- Decisions on tokens which can join Attrace Referral Farm
- Decisions on the incentives within referral farms
- Decisions on the value of the protocol fees and the split between oracles and referral farms budget 
- Decisions on the future product features to be built
