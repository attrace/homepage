## About Attrace

Attrace is a trustless Referral Protocol operated by Oracles capable of observing and detecting referrals across the blockchain universe. The protocol empowers “word-of-mouth” marketing for web3 assets in a trustless and decentralized manner, by linking promotions (e.g. referral links) with the on-chain user activity (blockchain transactions). Furthermore, it connects communities across various blockchains and platforms within a single ecosystem by supporting the multi-chain and cross chain referral capabilities. 

In practice the protocol enables crypto and NFT projects to incentivise referrals of their tokens, while rewarding those who contribute to their growth and adoption. Attrace App is envisioned as a referral marketplace where anyone can become part of the ecosystem and interact with the protocol, while direct integration and development of other decentralized apps will be possible in future in an open-sourced manner.

## Vision


We believe that “word-of-mouth” marketing drives an enormous value towards web3 projects and ecosystems. Furthermore, it tremendously helps the space grow by fueling mainstream adoption. Very often, those who are active in the space spread the word about the projects and tokens they believe in, or even recommend them to their friends, family or communities. 

Web3 brings opportunities to channel value directly to those who contribute to the projects and creators by “spreading the word” about them. Up to this point there was no way to properly measure that contribution, the added value, and the reputation of the actors. 

Therefore, Attrace is on its mission to create the first connected and trustless “word-of-mouth” ecosystem for web3. Whether communication happens via web2 channels (i.e. Twitter, Websites), web3 channels or via Metaverse, the protocol will be able to capture the value of “word-of-mouth” marketing that leads to web3 activity. The network of Oracles observes and captures the value of user acquisition in web3 that happens via link sharing (creating social graphs in web3).

We believe in a future where web3 will be connected across multiple networks and social channels where many new asset classes will be tokenized. Furthermore, we expect endless opportunities for synergy with “word-of-mouth” marketing. Imagined and designed as a blockchain and token agnostic protocol, Attrace aims to unlock “word-of-mouth” marketing potential across the entire blockchain universe.
