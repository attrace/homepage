Attrace is a trustless Referral Protocol operated by Oracles capable of observing and detecting referrals across the blockchain universe. The protocol empowers “word-of-mouth” marketing for web3 assets by linking promotions with the on-chain user activity. Furthermore, it connects communities across various blockchains and platforms within a single ecosystem by supporting the multi-chain and cross chain referral capabilities. 

In practice the protocol enables crypto and NFT projects to incentivise referrals of their tokens, while rewarding those who contribute to their growth and adoption. Attrace App is envisioned as a referral marketplace where anyone can become part of the ecosystem and interact with the protocol, while direct integration and development of other decentralized apps will be possible in future in an open-sourced manner.
