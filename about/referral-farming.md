# Referral farming
## Introduction
In 2021, Attrace went live with its revised proposition, a methodology for referrals in anticipation of web3. The world’s first referrals for web3 showed traction and adoption, especially on the Project / Crypto Creator side, where performance has been significantly better than anticipated.

In 2022 a major product update has been rolled out, the concept of Referral Farming. The key objective of this update was to obtain more traction on the Promoter side, as most Projects are looking for 3rd party Promoters. The first big update was to allow anyone to promote — or recommend — a crypto or NFT project without a Project bounty required up front. This allows anyone to promote — or recommend — a crypto or NFT project they believe in, at all times, without a Project bounty required up front. This will remove any remaining user friction and thus solving the “chicken and egg” problem. After the product update, anyone can become a promoter of any project they believe in and earn at all times $ATTR.

The second update was introcucing the concept of Referral Farming.

## What is Referral Farming
Referral Farming works in a similar way to Farming on a DEX, where yield farming-like rewards will be distributed for successful referrals (instead of providing liquidity). 
The concept of farming is that a project dedicates a daily budget to promote its tokenised asset. As an example, when a new crypto currency is launched, it could dedicate a daily budget to promote this token. The moment a promoter is joining this farm, and succesfully onboarded a buyer for this token, the daily budget is devided over these two players.

This creates the urgency to to start promoting a newly created farm ASAP, as the rewards will be higher if you are an early adopter of the project. The first participant gets the highest yield/commission, which will then go down with more value being contributed. 

The Attrace team believes this will have a large impact on Promoter adoption of the Attrace protocol as it has been a proven model for DEXs; it simply has never been done before for referral payouts. 

Currently, there are two Referral Farm types supported.


### Sponsored Referral Farm
Sponsored referral farms are farms created by projects in which they the daily reward is setup in the native promoted token. In other words, the promoters earn farming-like returns in the Project native crypto. 

As an example, imagine $MASK creates a sponsored farn with 1000 $MASK daily rewards. 
- A promoter creates a link of this farm, and shares it on its Twitter.
- One of its Twitter followers, follows the link, signs it. With this signature, a so called 'Proof of Recommendation' is stored within the Attrace Oracles
- Next 2000 $MASK is purchased by this Twitter follower on a supported DEX.
- 24 hours later, rewards are calculated. The daily reward of 1000 $MASK is devided between promoter and the buyer. 

Note that, when more promoters and referred buyers join this farm, the daily rewards will be devided between these players. In order words, early adopters of a new farm will have the highest yield.
### Attrace Referral Farm
Promoters earn farming-like returns in $ATTR for promoting any crypto or NFT project; this will also trigger community growth. This can be done on top of the Sponsored Referral Farm. 
As an example, Attrace could support the launch of a new token (and in future NFT collection). With every position increase, or NFT buy, an additional reward can be configured in the ATTR token (or potentially other tokens that would like that setup such support).
