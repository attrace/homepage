## What is Referral Farming
Referral Farming works in a similar way to Farming on a DEX, where yield farming-like rewards will be distributed for successful referrals (instead of providing liquidity). 
The concept of farming is that a project dedicates a daily budget to promote its tokenised asset. As an example, when a new crypto currency is launched, it could dedicate a daily budget to promote this token. The moment a promoter is joining this farm, and succesfully onboarded a buyer for this token, the daily budget is devided over these two players.


### Farming flow
The farming flow involves three players:
1. **Project:** The party that is looking for promotion for its digital asset. As an example a new crypto project that wants to create demand for its token, or a newly launch NFT collection
1. **Promotor:** The promotor is typically looking for a way to montise it's traffic or influence. This could a Twitter or YouTube account with large dedicated following, or a crypto news or statistics website that would like to earn from traffic being sent to a DEX or NFT market place
1. **Buyer:** Someone that got recommended by the promoter to buy in a farm and so can earn additional rewards from participating in a project.

The flow below explains in 5 steps how a farm is setup between the players

1. Create Farm
1. Refer to Farm
1. Buy to Farm
1. Observe & React Read more about the role and functionality in the [Oracles section](/about/oracles).
1. Harvest Rewards


## The farming effect: FOMO
The first participant gets the highest yield/commission, which will then go down with more value being contributed. This creates the urgency to to start promoting a newly created farm ASAP, as the rewards will be higher if you are an early adopter of the project. 

The Attrace team believes this will have a large impact on Promoter adoption of the Attrace protocol as it has been a proven model for DEXs; it simply has never been done before for referral payouts. 

Currently, there are two Referral Farm types supported.

### Sponsored Referral Farm
Sponsored referral farms are farms created by projects in which they the daily reward is setup in the native promoted token. In other words, the promoters earn farming-like returns in the Project native crypto. 

As an example, imagine $MASK creates a sponsored farn with 1000 $MASK daily rewards. 
- A promoter creates a link of this farm, and shares it on its Twitter.
- One of its Twitter followers, follows the link, signs it. With this signature, a so called 'Proof of Recommendation' is stored within the Attrace Oracles
- Next 2000 $MASK is purchased by this Twitter follower on a supported DEX.
- 24 hours later, rewards are calculated. The daily reward of 1000 $MASK is devided between promoter and the buyer. 

Note that, when more promoters and referred buyers join this farm, the daily rewards will be devided between these players. In order words, early adopters of a new farm will have the highest yield.

### Attrace Referral Farm
Promoters earn farming-like returns in $ATTR for promoting any crypto or NFT project; this will also trigger community growth. This can be done on top of the Sponsored Referral Farm. 

As an example, Attrace could support the launch of a new token (and in future NFT collection). With every position increase, or NFT buy, an additional reward can be configured in the ATTR token (or potentially other tokens that would like that setup such support).
