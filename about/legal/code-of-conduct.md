This Code of Conduct, as may be amended, supplemented or revised from time to time, forms an integral part of the Attrace Terms and Conditions. All participants must comply with this Code of Conduct in full.

This Code of Conduct has been prepared to protect the rights and safety of all. However, each participant is and remains responsible and liable for its actions and Attrace assumes no responsibility or liability to that respect. For the avoidance of doubt, Attrace is not responsible for content on third party websites and does not accept any liability for content on third party websites.

Each participant must comply with all laws, rules and regulations that are applicable to their activities, including but not limited to those pertaining to marketing, privacy, social media, consumer protection and advertising. Each participant must further comply with all applicable industry best practices and guidelines.

    * the participant is the sender of the email, pursuant to (anti-)SPAM rules (this includes that (i) the participant must be identified in the “From:” field of the email, (ii) the participant must state in the email how the participant obtained the recipient’s email address and (iii) the participant must make clear that Attrace is not the sender of the email).

1. Participant acknowledges that in the event that participant has breached this Code of Conduct, its name and address may in certain circumstances be disclosed by Attrace to a third party.
