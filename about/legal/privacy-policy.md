# 1. Personal Data

Personal data (also “Personally identifiable information”) includes individual information by which you as a natural person are or can be identified by, e.g. your name, address, telephone number, email address or date of birth, as well as information which does not reveal your name, but which relates to you or your device and enables you to be treated individually. Non-personally identifiable data is information that cannot be connected to your real identity, e.g. the number of users visiting our website or any other kind of aggregated information.

# 2. Collection of personal data and other information

The way you get in touch with Attrace stakeholders or technologies and services determine the scope of how personally identifiable information on you or other information is collected and processed. This Privacy Policy aims to keep you informed which personal and other kinds of data is received, why it is used and your rights in respect of that data. Data as a general term may include all kinds of information such as your name, your address or information on your device (e.g. your operating system or browser).

## 2.1. When visiting the Attrace website www.attrace.com

The Attrace webservers temporarily log traffic data provided by the device you use to enter the Attrace website (including the host name (IP address) of the requesting computer), date, time and duration of your visit, data specifications of your browser and operating system as well as the name of your access provider, and the website you were referred from to the Attrace website (so called Referrer URL). This information is stored in a log file until it is automatically deleted in accordance with the retention policy. The collection and processing of this data is carried out for the purposes of facilitating the use of the Attrace website (connection set-up), understanding how visitors use it and to ensure the security and stability of the Attrace systems as well as the technical administration of the network infrastructure. Attrace does not record your name, address, telephone number or email address, unless voluntarily provided by you, e.g. as part of signing up with the Attrace ecosystem.

### 2.1.1. Cookies

Attrace uses cookies on the website to optimise its usability. Cookies are small text files that are sent from our servers to your browser to be stored on your device (laptop, tablet, smartphone or similar). Cookies do not cause damage to your device, do not contain viruses, trojans or other malicious software. The cookie stores information, which is linked to the respective device used. This does not mean, however, that we store personal information about you or are aware of your identity. In general, cookies help to improve and optimise the usability of websites and other online services, including own websites and online services and those of others. The Attrace use of cookies is strictly compliant with any applicable cookie and data privacy legislation. Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Most cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID. Through the use of cookies, the Attrace team can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting. Cookies allow, as previously mentioned, to recognize websites users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our websites. The websites user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the websites is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user’s computer system. You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our websites by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be possible to use all the functions of our websites.

Attrace stores personal and any other kind of data strictly in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy legislations and will prevent unauthorized access to data to the best of the Attrace abilities.

# 4. Data security

Attrace takes all technical and organisational security measures required to protect your personal data from loss, unauthorised disclosure or other forms of misuse. Data is stored in a safe environment that is not open to public access. Your personal data may be encrypted before transmission in certain cases (e.g. processing your login data). This means that – support by your browser provided – communication between your device and the Attrace servers will include recognized encryption measures. The Attrace IT team has been trained in privacy matters and in dealing with data and information, which they gain access to in a responsible manner.

# 5. Individual Rights, Access, rectification, deletion and blockage

You have the right of access to your personal data at any time and may request rectification or erasure of your data. In case you registered on the Attrace website, you may use your client account to exercise these rights. While observing applicable privacy legislation Attrace will erase your data without any action required by you, if retention of your data is no longer necessary for the purpose pursued or retention is no longer allowed for any legal reason. Attrace may restrict processing instead of erasing your data where legally not allowed to erase (e.g. legal obligations to maintain your personal data).

# 6. Amendments
