## Introduction 

Attrace provides a cross-chain solution that does not require any (contract) integration. 

This is achieved by a network or oracles that is monitoring the onchain transactions.
At the heart of Attrace is the Oracle. 


## Concept 

By being blockchain agnostic by design, Oracles have the aim of capturing the value generation of ‘word of mouth’ marketing across the entire blockchain universe. They power referral farming by detecting and distributing rewards in a trustless manner. 

### Oracle Network

Oracles are joined together into a network which consists of gasless off-chain nodes that are capable of observing transactions of external networks. The network reacts as a pacemaker to transactions on external blockchains with a minimal block delay while operating in layer2 similar fashion where the source of truth comes externally. Therefore, oracles collect transactions coming from blockchains as well as the ProofOfRecommendation collected when interacting with Attrace App (later possible with partner integrations).  

The end result of the network is to reach an agreement on the state of referral by detecting value which came as a result of successful referral, and assigning rewards to those involved. The agreement is reached by majority via ongoing Oracle voting where the weight depends on the amount of $ATTR stake relative to the rest of the network.

### Security

Security of the protocol depends on the Oracles which is tied to their responsibility for detecting the value and assigning rewards. To ensure that the protocol is secure and that it can be trusted, Oracles are required to provide a sufficient amount of stake in $ATTR. In return for securing the protocol, the stakes receive protocol fees and staking rewards (to learn more go to rewards).  

## Become an Oracle

### Delegate Stake

It will be required for people to already have ATTR stake to become eligble to run an Oracle. Nomination is the process of becoming an Oracle where it is required to acheive a minimum amount of stake. So one can have a sufficient amount of tokens to meet the minimum required to run a node (without needing any delegated stake), or can acheive that minimum by others delegating stake to that node (delegated stake = voting). Hope this explains for now
