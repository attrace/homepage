We believe that “word-of-mouth” marketing drives an enormous value towards web3 projects and ecosystems. Furthermore, it tremendously helps the space grow by fueling mainstream adoption. Very often, those who are active in the space spread the word about the projects and tokens they believe in, or even recommend them to their friends, family or communities. 

Web3 brings opportunities to channel value directly to those who contribute to the projects and creators by “spreading the word” about them. Up to this point there was no way to properly measure that contribution and added value. 

Therefore, Attrace is on its mission to create the first connected and trustless “word-of-mouth” ecosystem for web3. Whether communication happens via web2 channels (i.e. Twitter, Websites), web3 channels or via Metaverse, the protocol will be able to capture the value of “word-of-mouth” marketing that leads to web3 activity. The network of Oracles observes and captures the value of user acquisition in web3 that happens via link sharing (creating social graphs in web3).

We believe in a future where web3 will be connected across multiple networks and social channels where many new asset classes will be tokenized. Furthermore, we expect endless opportunities for synergy with “word-of-mouth” marketing. Imagined and designed as a blockchain and token agnostic protocol, Attrace aims to unlock “word-of-mouth” marketing potential across the entire blockchain universe. 


Attrace unlocks the value of “word of mouth” marketing in web3 by linking promotions with the on-chain user activity. Web3 brings opportunities to channel value directly to those who contribute to crypto projects and creators, by spreading the word about their decentralized apps or web3 assets.
