Since two day ago, the farming rewards have continued to be paid out to those who provide liquidity to the ATTR/ETH pool on Sushiswap and stake their LP tokens.  
<!--truncate-->
However, we would like to inform the community of a plan to discontinue the farming rewards in the Sushi Onsen program. Starting two weeks from now, there will be no longer rewards provided for those who stake their LP tokens. 

The reason is that at the moment supplying liquidity on both Uniswap V3 and Sushiswap is not the most capital efficient way going forward. In the past few months, we have seen a sharp decrease in the overall trading volumes on Sushiswap, and given that Uniswap V3 has a much more efficient liquidity pool focused on specific price ranges, the Attrace team has decided to focus the supplied liquidity only within a single DEX (Uniswap V3). Additionally, this decision will reduce operation overhead moving forward. 

Overall, this should not have any impact on the ATTR token holders and it is strictly an operational decision which is better aligned with the longer term plans.
