## Coming soon: Referral Farms on Mask Network

With this partnership, the Attrace Referral Protocol will be integrated in Mask Network, thus enabling Twitter users to earn from referring web3 assets to followers.

The integration allows project owners to easily create unique Referral Farms which incentivises users to promote or buy their token while earning rewards in the process. New Referral Farms are immediately listed and visible for all Mask users, increasing exposure for their project.

By using the Masksâ€™ extension app, users can easily promote their favorite token by referring on Twitter directly without having to leave the social channel.

_Soon crypto enthusiasts can monetise their twitter influence. With the upcoming integration with Mask, Attrace will go live with 5 sponsored Referral Farms, stay tuned for more information._
