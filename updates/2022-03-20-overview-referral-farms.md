The Attrace protocol will introduce the concept of Referral Farms. There will be two types of Referral Farms, the _Single-Token Referral Farms_ and _Multi-Token Referral Farms_.

<!--truncate-->
## Single-Token Referral Farms
Suitable for crypto or NFT projects/protocols to sponsor referrals of their token. Any token that exists on a network supported by the Attrace protocol can have sponsored referrals by utilizing Single-Token Referral Farms (e.g. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)

Examples of Single-Token Referral Farms:

- Mask incentivises referrals and directs traffic/volume towards $MASK token by creating a MASK Referral Farm
- Cryptowalkers incentivises referrals and directs traffic/volume towards their NFT collection by creating a Cryptowalkers Referral Farm


## Multi-Token Referral Farms
These farms are the most suitable for ecosystems hosting token exchanges that are willing to incentivise traffic/volume towards their protocols (e.g., DEX, Marketplaces, blockchain networks). Any token that exists on networks supported by the Attrace protocol can have sponsored referrals by utilizing Multi-Token Referral Farms (i.e. ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155)

Examples of potential Multi-Token Referral Farms:

- An NFT marketplace incentivises referrals and directs traffic/volume towards its smart contract by creating a Multi-Token Referral Farm which includes NFT collections traded on the marketplace
- A DEX incentivises referrals and directs traffic/volume towards its smart contract, by creating Multi-Token Referral Farms which includes crypto tokens traded on the DEX
- Blockchain network (traffic towards network tokens and protocols) incentivises referrals and directs traffic/volume towards the network, by creating Multi-Token Referral Farms which includes tokens and protocols on the network
